```yml
[profile.dev]
opt-level = 0

opt-level = 3
```
The opt-level setting controls the number of optimizations Rust will apply to your code, with a range of 0 to 3.

*Yanking*
Yanking a version prevents new projects from depending on that version while allowing all existing projects that depend on it to continue. 
Essentially, a yank means that all projects with a Cargo.lock will not break, and any future Cargo.lock files generated will not use the yanked version.

The `cargo install` command allows you to install and use binary crates locally.
Note that you can only install packages that have binary targets. 
A binary target is the runnable program that is created if the crate has a src/main.rs file or another file specified as a binary, as opposed to a library target that isnâ€™t runnable on its own but is suitable for including within other programs.
