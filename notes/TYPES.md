Each signed variant can store numbers from -(2**(n - 1)) to 2**(n - 1) - 1 inclusive, where n is the number of bits that variant uses. 

So an i8 can store numbers from -(2**7) to 2**7 - 1, which equals -128 to 127. 
Unsigned variants can store numbers from 0 to 2**n - 1, so a u8 can store numbers from 0 to 2**8 - 1, which equals 0 to 255.

Integer Types
An integer is a number without a fractional component. We used one integer type in Chapter 2, the u32 type. This type declaration indicates that the value itâ€™s associated with should be an unsigned integer (signed integer types start with i instead of u) that takes up 32 bits of space. Table 3-1 shows the built-in integer types in Rust. We can use any of these variants to declare the type of an integer value.

Table 3-1: Integer Types in Rust

Length	      Signed	    Unsigned
8-bit	        i8	        u8
16-bit	      i16	        u16
32-bit	      i32	        u32
64-bit	      i64	        u64
128-bit	      i128	      u128
arch	        isize	      usize

# Compound Types
Compound types can group multiple values into one type. Rust has two primitive compound types: tuples and arrays.
