```rs
#[derive(Debug)] // so we can inspect the state in a minute
enum UsState {
    Alabama,
    Alaska,
    // --snip--
}

enum Coin {
    Penny,
    Nickel,
    Dime,
    Quarter(UsState),
}
```

And then switching over Coin looks like:
```rs
fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -> u8 {
    match coin {
        Coin::Penny => 1,
        Coin::Nickel => 5,
        Coin::Dime => 10,
        Coin::Quarter(state) => {
            println!("State quarter from {state:?}!");
            25
        }
    }
}
```

```rs
fn plus_one(x: Option<i32>) -> Option<i32> {
    match x {
        None => None,
        Some(i) => Some(i + 1),
    }
}

let five = Some(5);
let six = plus_one(five);
let none = plus_one(None);
```

Matches in Rust are exhaustive: we must exhaust every last possibility in order for the code to be valid. Especially in the case of Option<T>, when Rust prevents us from forgetting to explicitly handle the None case, it protects us from assuming that we have a value when we might have null, thus making the billion-dollar mistake discussed earlier impossible.

```rs
let dice_roll = 9;
match dice_roll {
    3 => add_fancy_hat(),
    7 => remove_fancy_hat(),
    other => move_player(other),
}

fn add_fancy_hat() {}
fn remove_fancy_hat() {}
fn move_player(num_spaces: u8) {}
```

```rs
let dice_roll = 9;
match dice_roll {
    3 => add_fancy_hat(),
    7 => remove_fancy_hat(),
    _ => reroll(),
}

fn add_fancy_hat() {}
fn remove_fancy_hat() {}
fn reroll() {}
```

Finally, weâ€™ll change the rules of the game one more time so that nothing else happens on your turn if you roll anything other than a 3 or a 7. We can express that by using the unit value (the empty tuple type
```rs
let dice_roll = 9;
match dice_roll {
    3 => add_fancy_hat(),
    7 => remove_fancy_hat(),
    _ => (),
}

fn add_fancy_hat() {}
fn remove_fancy_hat() {}
```

```rs
let config_max = Some(3u8);
match config_max {
    Some(max) => println!("The maximum is configured to be {max}"),
    _ => (),
}
```

Is the same as...

```rs
let config_max = Some(3u8);
if let Some(max) = config_max {
    println!("The maximum is configured to be {max}");
}
```

In other words, you can think of if let as syntax sugar for a match that runs code when the value matches one pattern and then ignores all other values.

And it follows...

```rs
let mut count = 0;
match coin {
    Coin::Quarter(state) => println!("State quarter from {state:?}!"),
    _ => count += 1,
}
```

Is the same as...

```rs
let mut count = 0;
if let Coin::Quarter(state) = coin {
    println!("State quarter from {state:?}!");
} else {
    count += 1;
}
```

One common pattern is to perform some computation when a value is present and return a default value otherwise.

```rs
impl UsState {
    fn existed_in(&self, year: u16) -> bool {
        match self {
            UsState::Alabama => year >= 1819,
            UsState::Alaska => year >= 1959,
            // -- snip --
        }
    }
}
```

```rs
fn describe_state_quarter(coin: Coin) -> Option<String> {
    if let Coin::Quarter(state) = coin {
        if state.existed_in(1900) {
            Some(format!("{state:?} is pretty old, for America!"))
        } else {
            Some(format!("{state:?} is relatively new."))
        }
    } else {
        None
    }
}
```

Can better be expressed like...

```rs
fn describe_state_quarter(coin: Coin) -> Option<String> {
    let state = if let Coin::Quarter(state) = coin {
        state
    } else {
        return None;
    };

    if state.existed_in(1900) {
        Some(format!("{state:?} is pretty old, for America!"))
    } else {
        Some(format!("{state:?} is relatively new."))
    }
}
```

And even bettwe using let-else...

```rs
fn describe_state_quarter(coin: Coin) -> Option<String> {
    let Coin::Quarter(state) = coin else {
        return None;
    };

    if state.existed_in(1900) {
        Some(format!("{state:?} is pretty old, for America!"))
    } else {
        Some(format!("{state:?} is relatively new."))
    }
}
```

```rs
```
